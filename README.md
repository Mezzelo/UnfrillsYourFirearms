# Unfrills Your Firearms 0.9.0 - for game version 0.2.4
Content mod for Project Silverfish, by Siris Pendrake - https://store.steampowered.com/app/2941710/Project_Silverfish/
Currently adds 128 new firearms — with about a dozen of those being variants of new additions or vanilla weapons.

Please note that this mod's content (items) should be forward compatible, barring fundamental mechanical changes, but I would advise removing any patch files (files ending in **_P** included in this mod) after updates to avoid overwriting new content (if the game even still works with them after an update)

i'd recommend just waiting til the next update it'll work a lot better with the progression curve ironed out, but hey if you were planning on doing a run anyway

All implementation & design work is my own, utilizing assets from the base game.

The vast majority of base models and some rigs are the work of TastyTony — https://sketchfab.com/TastyTony/ — with the following exceptions

SamanthaCFord: Thompson Contender, 38 Special & Snubnose Revolver - https://sketchfab.com/samanthacford
D_U: M79 Launcher, Mars Automatic Pistol - https://sketchfab.com/DU1701
Kaan: VP-70 - https://sketchfab.com/swagmasterkaan
Ryukotsuki: Spectre M4 - https://sketchfab.com/ryukotsuki
GoldbergR: MP412 Rex - https://sketchfab.com/GoldbergR

All models received complete topology/optimization passes & original UV, rigging & animation work.  In addition, the following weapons are my own original models:
COP 357, XR9-S
The following models include original modeling work derivative of TastyTony's models: L22, SR-3M Vikhr, Taurus Circuit Judge, Serbu Shorty, AWS 1911, Remington Model 81 Police, & several more variants with changes too minor to note
