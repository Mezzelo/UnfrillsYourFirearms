# Unfrills Your Firearms 0.9.0 - for game version 0.2.4
Content mod for Project Silverfish, by Siris Pendrake - https://store.steampowered.com/app/2941710/Project_Silverfish/

Currently adds 128 new firearms — with about a dozen of those being variants of new additions or vanilla weapons.

i'd recommend just waiting til the next update it'll work a lot better with the progression curve ironed out, but hey if you were planning on doing a run anyway

# Installation
Simply drop the contents of the zip folder into your game's Paks folder.  This can be found in [GAME ROOT DIRECTORY]/Content/Paks.

You can uninstall it by removing those files.  However, items added by this mod will become non-functional — I would recommend simply removing this mod's patch files (files ending in **_P** included in the .zip) for uninstallation, unless you plan on starting a new anyway.

Please note that updating or reinstalling the game will **not** uninstall this mod's files.

# Compatibility
This mod's changes to the game's spawn tables will be incompatible with any other mod that modifies spawn tables — shop offerings, NPC equipment & world loot — without dedicated compatibility fixes.  Its items should be universally compatible.

Please note that this mod's content (items) should be forward compatible, barring fundamental mechanical changes, but I would advise removing this mod's patch files (files ending in **_P** included in the .zip) after updates to avoid overwriting new content (if the game even still works with them after an update)

# Credits
All implementation & design work is my own, utilizing assets from the base game.

The vast majority of base models and some rigs are the work of TastyTony — https://sketchfab.com/TastyTony/ — with the following exceptions

All models received complete topology/optimization passes & original UV, rigging & animation work.  In addition, the following weapons are my own original models:

The following models include original modeling work derivative of TastyTony's models: L22, SR-3M Vikhr, Taurus Circuit Judge, Serbu Shorty, AWS 1911, Remington Model 81 Police, & several more variants with changes too minor to note
